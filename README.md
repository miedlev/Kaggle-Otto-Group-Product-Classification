### Kaggle Competition | [Otto Group Product Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge/data)

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition / the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

#### 1. My Conclusion Analysis Report - Jupyter Notebook
* [TitanicFinal Analysis](https://github.com/miedlev/Kaggle-Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster/blob/master/TitanicFinal%20part.ipynb)


#### 2. About Data :
* the The training set should be used to build machine learning models. 
* The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes.

#### 3. Process Introduction :
It is a competition that can be said to be Kaggle's introductory period and conducts a Python-based analysis. My focusins was on 
1. dummy variable generation
2. feature engineering
3. word-based column generation
4. continuous variables range
5. tree-based model

#### 4. Dependencies & Tech :

* [IPython](http://ipython.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

#### 5. Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster
The Otto Group is one of the worldâ€™s biggest e-commerce companies, with subsidiaries in more than 20 countries, including Crate & Barrel (USA), Otto.de (Germany) and 3 Suisses (France). 
We are selling millions of products worldwide every day, with several thousand products being added to our product line.

A consistent analysis of the performance of our products is crucial. However, due to our diverse global infrastructure, many identical products get classified differently. Therefore, the quality of our product analysis depends heavily on the ability to accurately cluster similar products. 
The better the classification, the more insights we can generate about our product range.
